# MultiProcess-Merge-Sort
A merge sort algorithm implementation in C, with multiple processes created for sorting sub-arrays at each divide step. `fork()` <br \>is used to create children processes.

##Usage:
The input.txt file contains the input array that is to be sorted. First number in the file is the number of elements (n) in the array that need to be sorted. <br \>The next n+1 lines are the array elements.

Use the `make` command and run using ./merge
